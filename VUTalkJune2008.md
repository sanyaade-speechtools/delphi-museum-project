I (Patrick) gave a talk about Delphi (largely based upon the presentation for our [MW2008 paper](http://www.archimuse.com/mw2008/papers/schmitz/schmitz.html) )and the CONCUR project to a group of AI and museum informatics types at the [Vrije Universiteit(VU)](http://www.vu.nl) in Amsterdam. The talk skimmed over Delphi and the internals of that system, along with some information about CONCUR. It seemed to be well-received. There were plenty of questions and comments, and even the hard-core semantics folks said nice things and asked to keep in touch on CONCUR.

Afterwards, I met with [Jacco can Ossenbruggen](http://homepages.cwi.nl/~jrvosse/), [Guus Schreiber](http://www.cs.vu.nl/~guus/), [Lora Aroyo](http://www.cs.vu.nl/~laroyo/) and [Anna Tordai](http://www.cs.vu.nl/~atordai/). Although they are interested in the shallow NLP and ontology maintenance work, we ended up talking about collaborating on the [CollectionSpace project](http://wiki.fluidproject.org/display/collectionspace/CollectionSpace).
